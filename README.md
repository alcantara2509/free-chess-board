# Interactive Chessboard

## About the Project

This project is a personal challenge where I created an **interactive chessboard** from scratch, without using external libraries or pre-written code. The goal was to develop an application that simulates the experience of playing chess, allowing users to drag and drop pieces on the board. To manage and optimize the code, I used **Webpack** as a module bundler.

## Features

- **Chessboard**: An 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares.
- **Draggable Pieces**: Pieces can be dragged and dropped onto different squares on the board.
- **Interactivity**: Users can interact with the board, moving pieces as they would in a real chess game.
- **No Dependencies**: The project was developed using only HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript, without additional libraries or frameworks.
- **Bundled with Webpack**: The code is organized and optimized through Webpack, allowing for better module and resource management.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: To structure the content of the board and pieces.
- **CSS3**: For styling the board and pieces, ensuring an appealing visual presentation.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the logic for dragging and dropping pieces, as well as user interaction.
- **Webpack**: To bundle JavaScript modules and optimize the development workflow.
